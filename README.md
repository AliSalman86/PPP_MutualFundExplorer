# PPP_MutualFundExplorer

What PPP stands for?
Personal Python Projects, a serious of personal projects that I am working on to boost my experience in Python

Why Mutual Funds Explorer?
I want to develop this app as a solution to many questions I always see from retailer investors about how they can get as much data as possible in one place to make an informed decision when they self directing thier brockerage and/or IRA accounts

Challenges:
1- Best source(s) for data to be used in the app -> Right now I am importing data of individual funds to develop some of the main functionalities and maybe build a MVP

TBC...
